    "Software engineers apply engineering principles to design, build, and maintain entire, complex systems. Software developers, in contrast, focus more specifically on writing code to create, test, and deploy specific software features. While roles often overlap in smaller companies, engineers generally take a broader, system-level approach. \n",
